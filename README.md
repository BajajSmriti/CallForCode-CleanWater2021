# CallForCode-CleanWater2021
Technological prophecy of the biosphere- Visualizing insights on how the biosphere is impacting clean water.

## Description
### What's the problem?
Water makes 3/4th of our bodies and is the most threatened natural resource due to climate change. It is essential for life on the planet. According to the WHO, approximately 30% of the world's population does not have access to safe drinking water. But, what could be the reason behind this scarcity? The Biosphere. Our biosphere dictates how water is affected today and we have data collected from various sources that is a testament. 

### How can technology help?
If we analyze our ecosystem, we can see many prevailing factors like, Arable land, the changes in precipitation percentage over a decade and GDP deflation rates. Of these, country-wise analysis can help recognize the shortcomings in these sectors and help in the improved availability of clean water.

### The idea
With the industrial setbacks due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were more dependent on machines, people and SME's experiences. The data collected through these and many other sources via [aquastat](http://www.fao.org/aquastat/en/) has helped us identify the culprits of our biosphere. Hereby, the contributors have visualized some very critical insights backed by IBM Cloud and Watson Services which will enable us to bridge the gaps between vast inequalities in the accessibility, availability, and quality of the services.

### Subsection 1.1

Mauris odio ante, rhoncus et varius vel, vulputate et enim. Aliquam erat volutpat. Proin lacinia libero velit, a dictum sapien ultricies quis. Vivamus dolor nibh, efficitur in ipsum vitae, faucibus eleifend felis.

### Subsection 1.2

Nullam nec lectus massa. Proin feugiat placerat nisi lacinia lobortis. Duis efficitur ac orci ac lobortis.

### Conclusion

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nunc lacinia nisi ut fringilla sodales. Etiam elementum a arcu vel fringilla. Nulla ac efficitur felis. In a nisi bibendum, efficitur felis vel, consectetur quam. Aenean ornare justo velit, sed malesuada massa efficitur ut. Sed non augue vel risus tempus lacinia ac nec est. Nunc vel finibus felis. Vivamus felis diam, porta sed rhoncus eu, luctus eget justo. 

### Results

Nullam nec lectus massa. Proin feugiat placerat nisi lacinia lobortis. Duis efficitur ac orci ac lobortis.
